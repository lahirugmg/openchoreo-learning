# OpenChoreo Learning Plan

This repository tracks a structured onboarding path for becoming an OpenChoreo contributor.

## What This Repo Contains
- `openchoreo-contributor-learning-plan.md`
  - The full 8-module contributor plan (Controller/API focus, native Rancher Desktop + k3d setup).
- `progress-log.md`
  - Module-by-module execution log with outcomes, blockers, and next steps.

## Purpose
- Keep the learning journey explicit and trackable.
- Record evidence of completed milestones before moving to deeper contribution work.
- Maintain a repeatable onboarding path for future contributors.

## How to Use
1. Follow `openchoreo-contributor-learning-plan.md` module by module.
2. Update `progress-log.md` as you complete milestones.
3. Run all commands from the main OpenChoreo source repo (`code/openchoreo`) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
4. Use this repo for planning and tracking only; implement code and PR work in the source repo.

## Current Focus
- First contribution target:
  - Fix outdated commands in `docs/contributors/contribute.md` in the main OpenChoreo repo.
- Second contribution target:
  - Submit one small Controller/API bug fix or test improvement.
