# OpenChoreo Learning Plan

This repository tracks a structured onboarding path for becoming an OpenChoreo contributor.

## What This Repo Contains
- `openchoreo-contributor-learning-plan.md`
  - The full 8-module contributor plan (Controller/API focus, native Rancher Desktop + k3d setup).
- `progress-log.md`
  - Module-by-module execution log with outcomes, blockers, and next steps.
- `module-1-interactive-guide.md`
  - Interactive, hands-on guide for Module 1 designed for AI coding agents (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
  - Learn-by-doing approach with explanations of each command and concept.

## Purpose
- Keep the learning journey explicit and trackable.
- Record evidence of completed milestones before moving to deeper contribution work.
- Maintain a repeatable onboarding path for future contributors.

## How to Use

### For Self-Paced Learning
1. Follow `openchoreo-contributor-learning-plan.md` module by module.
2. Update `progress-log.md` as you complete milestones.
3. Run all commands from the main OpenChoreo source repo (`code/openchoreo`) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
4. Use this repo for planning and tracking only; implement code and PR work in the source repo.

### Learning with AI Coding Agents
1. Start with [module-1-interactive-guide.md](module-1-interactive-guide.md) for a hands-on, conversational learning experience.
2. Work with your AI agent (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to execute commands step-by-step.
3. Ask questions about each command to deepen your understanding.
4. The guide explains concepts as you go and includes verification steps.
5. Update `progress-log.md` after completing each phase.

## Current Focus
- First contribution target:
  - Fix outdated commands in `docs/contributors/contribute.md` in the main OpenChoreo repo.
- Second contribution target:
  - Submit one small Controller/API bug fix or test improvement.
